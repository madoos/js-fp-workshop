_Gigigo workshop_

## Topics

High order functions(arity, pointfree style, curry)
referentional transparency
Avoid side efects(inmutability)
Composition


encapsulation
inheritance,
polymorphism


S (SRP) in FP a function creates ALWAYS the same output for the same arguments this is called referential transparency
O (OCP) in FP there is a concept called algebraic data types, have a look how it relates to Class hierarchies and what problem both try to solve 1
L (LSP) Liskov Substitution Principle is Contravariance 2
D (DIP) in general functional programming achieves abstraction through function composition, there are also other mechanism with the help of category theory(for example monoid or functor), for "Dependency Injection" 3
