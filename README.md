# js-fp-workshop

_Gigigo workshop_

## Motivation

* Learn functional concepts to use them with streams
* Problematize how FP can help us improve as programmers
* Get tools to analyze as a team if the FP is useful to solve our problems
* Reduce my [mount stupid](http://www.javiergarzas.com/2017/12/el-monte-de-la-estupidez.html)
* Generate an open debate
* Check how the FP is very related to the streams

# workshop structure

* Core FP concepts in relation to POO
* Challenge
* Solve a problem in a classical way
* Solve a problem using FP concepts
* How to use FP concepts with streams
* Debate (with practical demonstrations, NOT ALLOW ONLY THEORY)

## Topics

* Why FP in JS?
* Why use streams?
* Why use FP?
* What is FP?
* What is a paradigm?
* Streams

## Core concepts of the functional programing in comparison with the OOP

### FP

* Few data structures many operations
* High order functions(arity, pointfree style, curry)
* Referentional transparency(memoize)
* Composition(curry)
* Avoid side efects(inmutability)

### POO

* encapsulation
* inheritance
* polymorphism


### List operations

* map
* reduce
* filter
